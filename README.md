# LeapfrogAI Deployment Guide

> [!WARNING]  
> The instructions in this repository require knowledge of Docker, Unix-based CLIs, GPU computing, and Kubernetes.

This repository contains documentation for deploying LeapfrogAI. LeapfrogAI an AI-as-a-service (AaaS) platform that brings the various capabilities and modalities of AI models to any environment, from cloud-based deployments to ingress/egress-limited servers. LeapfrogAI allows teams to deploy APIs that shadow OpenAI's API specification, enabling end-users and developers to build and use tools for almost any model and code library on the market All of this is done on your local machine, environment, etc., allowing the user to keep their information and sensitive data secure in their own environment.

Visit the main [LeapfrogAI repository](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/leapfrogai) for more details.

## Quickstart

Don't know Kubernetes that well, or just want to get something working locally as quickly as possible? Then just go to the [Tadpole repository](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/tadpole) skip directly to a super-simplified Docker deployment using `docker compose`.

> [!NOTE]  
> Tadpole is only for local testing and development, and not meant for production. It also only presents a limited set of LeapfrogAI's capabilities.

Our goal for LeapfrogAI is to also simplify the Kubernetes-based deployment of LeapfrogAI into a single command; however, this repository's instructions will provide the user with as much customizability as possible during installation.

## Instructions

The instructions are located in the [INSTALL-CPU.md]("./INSTALL-CPU.md") and [INSTALL-NVIDIA.md]("./INSTALL-NVIDIA.md"), where each markdown file contains an a detailed guide on how to install LeapfrogAI on systems that are CPU-only and contain both CPU and NVIDIA GPU(s), respectively.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> GPU and CPU installation are very similar, so if you are installing with GPU support, bring the INSTALL-CPU.md as well, since all the GPU related instructions only point out the steps that vary from the CPU instructions.

## Tested Environments

Below are some of the operating systems, architectures, and system specifications that we have tested our deployment instructions on.

In the future, our goal is to add instructions and test compatibility on other environments, e.g., AMD GPU(s), Metal acceleration.

> [!NOTE]  
> The the speed and quality of LeapfrogAI and its hosted AI models depends heavily on the presence of a strong GPU to offload model layers to.
